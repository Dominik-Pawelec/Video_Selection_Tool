# Video_Selection_Tool

## Description

This program will automate extracting given clips from recording session. 

### TODO:
1. Make python script/library allowing extracting files from given directory, create clips based on "selection" txt file, way to save clips into another folder and other utilities.
2. Make app usable for humans: make frontend of application, allow searching through folders etc.
3. Find a way of resolving human errors like finding misspelled numbers in "selection", not precise timestamps
4. Probably things I'll learn about in the future
